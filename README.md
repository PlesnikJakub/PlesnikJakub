My name is Jakub and I have been working as a software developer for 7 years. 

- I do profile myself as a **full stack** developer with prefered technology stack containign **Vue.js, .Net / Php Laravel**.:heart:
- I am big fan of clean code, clean architecture and TDD.
    - Even though I sometimes strougle to apply these concepts to my own work. :see_no_evil:
- I have masters degree in CS and I continue as a phd student at **VSB - Technical University of Ostrava.** :man_teacher:
- My field of study is **Data Science**:test_tube: with focus on graphs/networks. 
- My latest work focuses on **Twitter analysis** and dependency between politics in Czech Republic.
